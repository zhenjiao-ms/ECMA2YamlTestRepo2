  type: Interface
  summary: Represents the status of an asynchronous operation.
  remarks: "The IAsyncResult interface is implemented by classes containing methods that can operate asynchronously. It is the return type of methods that initiate an asynchronous operation, such as <xref:System.IO.FileStream.BeginRead%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and it is passed to methods that conclude an asynchronous operation, such as <xref:System.IO.FileStream.EndRead%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. IAsyncResult objects are also passed to methods invoked by <xref:System.AsyncCallback> delegates when an asynchronous operation completes.  \n  \n An object that supports the IAsyncResult interface stores state information for an asynchronous operation and provides a synchronization object to allow threads to be signaled when the operation completes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.AsyncResult> class is the implementation of IAsyncResult that is returned by the `BeginInvoke` method when you use a delegate to call a method asynchronously.  \n  \n For a detailed description of how the IAsyncResult interface is used, see the [Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously](../Topic/Calling%20Synchronous%20Methods%20Asynchronously.md) topic."
  example:
  - "The following example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.AsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> property to get a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle>, and how to wait for an asynchronous call on a delegate. The <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> is signaled when the asynchronous call completes, and you can wait for it by calling the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> method.  \n  \n The example consists of two classes: the class that contains the method that is called asynchronously, and the class that contains the `Main` method that makes the call.  \n  \n For more information and more examples of calling methods asynchronously by using delegates, see [Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously](../Topic/Calling%20Synchronous%20Methods%20Asynchronously.md).  \n  \n [!code-vb[AsyncDelegateExamples#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.iasyncresult_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[AsyncDelegateExamples#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.iasyncresult_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[AsyncDelegateExamples#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.iasyncresult_1.cpp)]  \n[!code-vb[AsyncDelegateExamples#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.iasyncresult_2.vb)]\n[!code-cpp[AsyncDelegateExamples#3](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.iasyncresult_2.cpp)]\n[!code-cs[AsyncDelegateExamples#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.iasyncresult_2.cs)]"

  remarks: "The return value allows the client to wait for an asynchronous operation to complete instead of polling <xref:System.IAsyncResult.IsCompleted%2A> until the operation concludes. The return value can be used to perform a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A>, <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny%2A>, or <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A> operation.  \n  \n The common language runtime supplies a number of waitable objects, such as <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent>, <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent>, and <xref:System.Threading.Mutex>, all of which mirror Win32 synchronization primitives."

  summary: Gets a value that indicates whether the asynchronous operation has completed.
  remarks: When this property is `true`, you can assume it is safe to discard any resources you allocate for use by the asynchronous operation.
  example:
  - "The following example shows how to use the IsCompleted property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> to discover when an asynchronous call completes. In this case, the asynchronous call is made by using the `BeginInvoke` method of a delegate. You might use the IsCompleted property to poll for completion when making the asynchronous call from a thread that services the user interface. Polling for completion allows the calling thread to continue executing while the asynchronous call executes on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread.  \n  \n The example consists of two classes: the class that contains the method that is called asynchronously, and the class that contains the `Main` method that makes the call.  \n  \n For more information and more examples of calling methods asynchronously by using delegates, see [Calling Synchronous Methods Asynchronously](../Topic/Calling%20Synchronous%20Methods%20Asynchronously.md).  \n  \n [!code-vb[AsyncDelegateExamples#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.iasyncresult.is_1.vb)]\n [!code-cs[AsyncDelegateExamples#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.iasyncresult.is_1.cs)]\n [!code-cpp[AsyncDelegateExamples#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/p-system.iasyncresult.is_1.cpp)]  \n[!code-cpp[AsyncDelegateExamples#4](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/p-system.iasyncresult.is_2.cpp)]\n[!code-cs[AsyncDelegateExamples#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/p-system.iasyncresult.is_2.cs)]\n[!code-vb[AsyncDelegateExamples#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/p-system.iasyncresult.is_2.vb)]"
