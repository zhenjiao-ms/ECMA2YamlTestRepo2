  summary: The exception that is thrown when an invoked method is not supported, or when there is an attempt to read, seek, or write to a stream that does not support the invoked functionality.
  remarks: "NotSupportedException indicates that no implementation exists for an invoked method or property.  \n  \n NotSupportedException uses the HRESULT COR_E_NOTSUPPORTED, which has the value 0x80131515.  \n  \n For a list of initial property values for an instance of NotSupportedException, see the <xref:System.NotSupportedException.%23ctor%2A> constructors.  \n  \n## Throwing a NotSupportedException exception  \n You might consider throwing a NotSupportedException exception in the following cases:  \n  \n-   You are implementing a general-purpose interface, and number of the methods have no meaningful implementation. For example, if you are creating a date and time type that implements the <xref:System.IConvertible> interface, you would throw a NotSupportedException exception for most of the conversions.  \n  \n-   You've inherited from an abstract class that requires that you override a number of methods. However, you're only prepared to provide an implementation for a subset of these. For the methods that you decide not to implement, you can choose to throw a NotSupportedException.  \n  \n-   You are defining a general-purpose type with a state that enables operations conditionally. For example, your type can be either read-only or read-write. In that case:  \n  \n    -   If the object is read-only, attempting to assign values to the properties of an instance or call methods that modify instance state should throw  a NotSupportedException exception.  \n  \n    -   You should implement a property that returns a <xref:System.Boolean> value that indicates whether particular functionality is available. For example, for a type that can be either read-only or read-write, you could implement a `IsReadOnly` property that indicates whether the set of read-write methods are available or unavailable.  \n  \n## Handling a NotSupportedException exception  \n The NotSupportedException exception indicates that a method has no implementation and that you should not call it.  You should not handle the exception. Instead, what you should do depends on the cause of the exception:  whether an implementation is completely absent , or the member invocation is inconsistent with the purpose of an object (such as a call to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Read%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method on a read-only <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object .  \n  \n **An implementation has not been provided because the operation cannot be performed in a meaningful way.**  \n This is a common exception when you are calling methods on an object that provides implementations for the methods of an abstract base class, or that implements a general-purpose interface, and the method has no meaningful implementation.  \n  \n For example, the <xref:System.Convert> class implements the <xref:System.IConvertible> interface, which means that it must include a method to convert every primitive type to every other primitive type. Many of those conversions, however, are not possible. As a result, a call to the <xref:System.Convert.ToBoolean%28System.DateTime%29?displayProperty=fullName> method, for instance, throws a NotSupportedException exception because there is no possible conversion between a <xref:System.DateTime> and a <xref:System.Boolean> value  \n  \n To eliminate the exception, you should eliminate the method call.  \n  \n **The method call is not supported given the state of the object.**  \n You are attempting to invoke a member whose functionality is unavailable because of the object's state. You can eliminate the exception in one of three ways:  \n  \n-   You know the state of the object in advance, but you've invoked an unsupported method or property. In this case, the member invocation is an error, and you can eliminate it.  \n  \n-   You know the state of the object in advance (usually because your code has instantiated it), but the object is mis-configured. The following example illustrates this issue. It creates a read-only <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object  and then attempts to write to it.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[System.NotSupportedException#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.notsupportedexc_1.vb)]\n     [!code-cs[System.NotSupportedException#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.notsupportedexc_1.cs)]  \n  \n     You can eliminate the exception by ensuring that the instantiated object supports the functionality you intend. The following example addresses the problem of the read-only <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object by providing the correct arguments to the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.IO.FileMode%2CSystem.IO.FileAccess%29?displayProperty=fullName> constructor.  \n  \n-   You don't know the state of the object in advance, and the object doesn't support a particular operation. In most cases, the object should include a property or method that indicates whether it supports a particular set of operations. You can eliminate the exception by checking the value of the object and invoking the member only if appropriate.  \n  \n     The following example defines a `DetectEncoding` method that throws a NotSupportedException exception when it attempts to read from the beginning of a stream that does not support read access.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.NotSupportedException#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.notsupportedexc_2.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.NotSupportedException#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.notsupportedexc_2.vb)]  \n  \n     You can eliminate the exception by examining the value of the <xref:System.IO.FileStream.CanRead%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property  and exiting the method if the stream is read-only.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[System.NotSupportedException#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.notsupportedexc_3.vb)]\n     [!code-cs[System.NotSupportedException#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.notsupportedexc_3.cs)]  \n  \n## Related exception types  \n The NotSupportedException exception is closely related to two other exception types;  \n  \n <xref:System.NotImplementedException>.  \n This exception is thrown when a method could be implemented but is not, either because the member will be implemented in  a later version, the member is not available on  a particular platform, or the member belongs to an abstract class and a derived class must provide an implementation.  \n  \n <xref:System.InvalidOperationException>  \n This exception is thrown in scenarios in which it is generally sometimes possible for the object to perform the requested operation, and the object state determines whether the operation can be performed.  \n  \n## .NET Compact Framework notes  \n When working with the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/add/includes/compact-md.md)] and using P/Invoke on a native function, this exception may be thrown if:  \n  \n-   The declaration in managed code is incorrect.  \n  \n-   The [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/add/includes/compact-md.md)] does not support what you are trying to do.  \n  \n-   The DLL names are mangled on export.  \n  \n If a <xref:System.NotSupportedException.%23ctor%2A> exception is thrown, check:  \n  \n-   For any violations of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/add/includes/compact-md.md)] P/Invoke restrictions.  \n  \n-   For any arguments that require pre-allocated memory. If these exist, you should pass a reference to an existing variable.  \n  \n-   That the names of the exported functions are correct. This can be verified with [DumpBin.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c1h23y6c.aspx).  \n  \n-   That you are not attempting to pass too many arguments."
