  summary: Represents a single-precision floating-point number.
  remarks: "The Single value type represents a single-precision 32-bit number with values ranging from negative 3.402823e38 to positive 3.402823e38, as well as positive or negative zero, <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity>, <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity>, and not a number (<xref:System.Single.NaN>). It is intended to represent values that are extremely large (such as distances between planets or galaxies) or extremely small (such as the molecular mass of a substance in kilograms) and that often are imprecise (such as the distance from earth to another solar system). The Single type complies with the IEC 60559:1989 (IEEE 754) standard for binary floating-point arithmetic.  \n  \n This topic consists of the following sections:  \n  \n-   [Floating-point representation and precision](#Precision)  \n  \n-   [Testing for equality](#Equality)  \n  \n-   [Floating-point values and exceptions](#Exceptions)  \n  \n-   [Type conversion and the Single structure](#Conversion)  \n  \n-   [Floating-point functionality](#Functionality)  \n  \n Single provides methods to compare instances of this type, to convert the value of an instance to its string representation, and to convert the string representation of a number to an instance of this type. For information about how format specification codes control the string representation of value types, see [Formatting Types](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md), [Standard Numeric Format Strings](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md), and [Custom Numeric Format Strings](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Precision\"></a>   \n## Floating-point representation and precision  \n The Single data type stores single-precision floating-point values in a 32-bit binary format, as shown in the following table:  \n  \n|Part|Bits|  \n|----------|----------|  \n|Significand or mantissa|0-22|  \n|Exponent|23-30|  \n|Sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative)|31|  \n  \n Just as decimal fractions are unable to precisely represent some fractional values (such as 1/3 or <xref:System.Math.PI?displayProperty=fullName>), binary fractions are unable to represent some fractional values. For example, 2/10, which is represented precisely by .2 as a decimal fraction, is represented by .0011111001001100 as a binary fraction, with the pattern \"1100\" repeating to infinity. In this case, the floating-point value provides an imprecise representation of the number that it represents. Performing additional mathematical operations on the original floating-point value often increases its lack of precision. For example, if you compare the results of multiplying .3 by 10 and adding .3 to .3 nine times, you will see that addition produces the less precise result, because it involves eight more operations than multiplication. Note that this disparity is apparent only if you display the two Single values by using the \"R\" [standard numeric format string](../Topic/Standard%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md), which, if necessary, displays all 9 digits of precision supported by the Single type.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#3](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#3](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_1.vb)]  \n  \n Because some numbers cannot be represented exactly as fractional binary values, floating-point numbers can only approximate real numbers.  \n  \n All floating-point numbers have a limited number of significant digits, which also determines how accurately a floating-point value approximates a real number. A Single value has up to 7 decimal digits of precision, although a maximum of 9 digits is maintained internally. This means that some floating-point operations may lack the precision to change a floating-point value. The following example defines a large single-precision floating-point value, and then adds the product of <xref:System.Single.Epsilon?displayProperty=fullName> and one quadrillion to it. However, the product is too small to modify the original floating-point value. Its least significant digit is thousandths, whereas the most significant digit in the product is 1<sup>-312</sup>.  \n  \n [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#4](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_2.vb)]\n [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#4](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_2.cs)]  \n  \n The limited precision of a floating-point number has several consequences:  \n  \n-   Two floating-point numbers that appear equal for a particular precision might not compare equal because their least significant digits are different. In the following example, a series of numbers are added together, and their total is compared with their expected total. Although the two values appear to be the same, a call to the `Equals` method indicates that they are not.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_3.vb)]\n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_3.cs)]  \n  \n     If you change the format items in the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%28System.String%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName> statement from `{0}` and `{1}` to `{0:R}` and `{1:R}` to display all significant digits of the two Single values, it is clear that the two values are unequal because of a loss of precision during the addition operations. In this case, the issue can be resolved by calling the <xref:System.Math.Round%28System.Double%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to round the Single values to the desired precision before performing the comparison.  \n  \n-   A mathematical or comparison operation that uses a floating-point number might not yield the same result if a decimal number is used, because the binary floating-point number might not equal the decimal number. A previous example illustrated this by displaying the result of multiplying .3 by 10 and adding .3 to .3 nine times.  \n  \n     When accuracy in numeric operations with fractional values is important, use the <xref:System.Decimal> type instead of the Single type. When accuracy in numeric operations with integral values beyond the range of the <xref:System.Int64> or <xref:System.UInt64> types is important, use the <xref:System.Numerics.BigInteger> type.  \n  \n-   A value might not round-trip if a floating-point number is involved. A value is said to round-trip if an operation converts an original floating-point number to another form, an inverse operation transforms the converted form back to a floating-point number, and the final floating-point number is equal to the original floating-point number. The round trip might fail because one or more least significant digits are lost or changed in a conversion. In the following example, three Single values are converted to strings and saved in a file. As the output shows, although the values appear to be identical, the restored values are not equal to the original values.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#17](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_4.vb)]\n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#17](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_4.cs)]  \n  \n     In this case, the values can be successfully round-tripped by using the \"R\" [standard numeric format string](../Topic/Standard%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md) to preserve the full precision of Single values, as the following example shows.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#18](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_5.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#18](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_5.vb)]  \n  \n-   Single values have less precision than <xref:System.Double> values. A Single value that is converted to a seemingly equivalent <xref:System.Double> often does not equal the <xref:System.Double> value because of differences in precision. In the following example, the result of identical division operations is assigned to a <xref:System.Double> value and a Single value. After the Single value is cast to a <xref:System.Double>, a comparison of the two values shows that they are unequal.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Double.Structure#5](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_6.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Double.Structure#5](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_6.vb)]  \n  \n     To avoid this problem, either use the <xref:System.Double> data type in place of the Single data type, or use the <xref:System.Math.Round%2A> method so that both values have the same precision.  \n  \n<a name=\"Equality\"></a>   \n## Testing for equality  \n To be considered equal, two Single values must represent identical values. However, because of differences in precision between values, or because of a loss of precision by one or both values, floating-point values that are expected to be identical often turn out to be unequal due to differences in their least significant digits. As a result, calls to the <xref:System.Single.Equals%2A> method to determine whether two values are equal, or calls to the <xref:System.Single.CompareTo%2A> method to determine the relationship between two Single values, often yield unexpected results. This is evident in the following example, where two apparently equal Single values turn out to be unequal, because the first value has 7 digits of precision, whereas the second value has 9.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#9](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_7.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#9](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_7.vb)]  \n  \n Calculated values that follow different code paths and that are manipulated in different ways often prove to be unequal. In the following example, one Single value is squared, and then the square root is calculated to restore the original value. A second Single is multiplied by 3.51 and squared before the square root of the result is divided by 3.51 to restore the original value. Although the two values appear to be identical, a call to the <xref:System.Single.Equals%28System.Single%29> method indicates that they are not equal. Using the \"R\" standard format string to return a result string that displays all the significant digits of each Single value shows that the second value is .0000000000001 less than the first.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#10](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_8.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#10](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_8.vb)]  \n  \n In cases where a loss of precision is likely to affect the result of a comparison, you can use the following techniques instead of calling the <xref:System.Single.Equals%2A> or <xref:System.Single.CompareTo%2A> method:  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Math.Round%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to ensure that both values have the same precision. The following example modifies a previous example to use this approach so that two fractional values are equivalent.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#11](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_9.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#11](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_9.vb)]  \n  \n     Note that the problem of precision still applies to rounding of midpoint values. For more information, see the <xref:System.Math.Round%28System.Double%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.MidpointRounding%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n-   Test for approximate equality instead of equality. This technique requires that you define either an absolute amount by which the two values can differ but still be equal, or that you define a relative amount by which the smaller value can diverge from the larger value.  \n  \n    > [!WARNING]\n    >  <xref:System.Single.Epsilon?displayProperty=fullName> is sometimes used as an absolute measure of the distance between two Single values when testing for equality.  However, <xref:System.Single.Epsilon?displayProperty=fullName> measures the smallest possible value that can be added to, or subtracted from, a Single whose value is zero. For most positive and negative Single values, the value of <xref:System.Single.Epsilon?displayProperty=fullName> is too small to be detected. Therefore, except for values that are zero, we do not recommend its use in tests for equality.  \n  \n     The following example uses the latter approach to define an `IsApproximatelyEqual` method that tests the relative difference between two values. It also contrasts the result of calls to the `IsApproximatelyEqual` method and the <xref:System.Single.Equals%28System.Single%29> method.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#12](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_10.vb)]\n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#12](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_10.cs)]  \n  \n<a name=\"Exceptions\"></a>   \n## Floating-point values and exceptions  \n Operations with floating-point values do not throw exceptions, unlike operations with integral types, which throw exceptions in cases of illegal operations such as division by zero or overflow.  Instead, in these situations, the result of a floating-point operation is zero, positive infinity, negative infinity, or not a number (NaN):  \n  \n-   If the result of a floating-point operation is too small for the destination format, the result is zero. This can occur when two very small floating-point numbers are multiplied, as the following example shows.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_11.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_11.vb)]  \n  \n-   If the magnitude of the result of a floating-point operation exceeds the range of the destination format, the result of the operation is <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity> or <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity>, as appropriate for the sign of the result. The result of an operation that overflows <xref:System.Single.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName> is <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity>, and the result of an operation that overflows <xref:System.Single.MinValue?displayProperty=fullName> is <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity>, as the following example shows.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_12.vb)]\n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_12.cs)]  \n  \n     <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity> also results from a division by zero with a positive dividend, and <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity> results from a division by zero with a negative dividend.  \n  \n-   If a floating-point operation is invalid, the result of the operation is <xref:System.Single.NaN>. For example, <xref:System.Single.NaN> results from the following operations:  \n  \n    -   Division by zero with a dividend of zero. Note that other cases of division by zero result in either <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity> or <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity>.  \n  \n    -   Any floating-point operation with invalid input. For example, attempting to find the square root of a negative value returns <xref:System.Single.NaN>.  \n  \n    -   Any operation with an argument whose value is <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n<a name=\"Conversion\"></a>   \n## Type conversions and the Single structure  \n The Single structure does not define any explicit or implicit conversion operators; instead, conversions are implemented by the compiler.  \n  \n The following table lists the possible conversions of a value of the other primitive numeric types to a Single value, It also indicates whether the conversion is widening or narrowing and whether the resulting Single may have less precision than the original value.  \n  \n|Conversion from|Widening/narrowing|Possible loss of precision|  \n|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Byte>|Widening|No|  \n|<xref:System.Decimal>|Widening<br /><br /> Note that C# requires a cast operator.|Yes. <xref:System.Decimal> supports 29 decimal digits of precision; Single supports 9.|  \n|<xref:System.Double>|Narrowing; out-of-range values are converted to <xref:System.Double.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>.|Yes. <xref:System.Double> supports 17 decimal digits of precision; Single supports 9.|  \n|<xref:System.Int16>|Widening|No|  \n|<xref:System.Int32>|Widening|Yes. <xref:System.Int32> supports 10 decimal digits of precision; Single supports 9.|  \n|<xref:System.Int64>|Widening|Yes. <xref:System.Int64> supports 19 decimal digits of precision; Single supports 9.|  \n|<xref:System.SByte>|Widening|No|  \n|<xref:System.UInt16>|Widening|No|  \n|<xref:System.UInt32>|Widening|Yes. <xref:System.UInt32> supports 10 decimal digits of precision; Single supports 9.|  \n|<xref:System.UInt64>|Widening|Yes. <xref:System.Int64> supports 20 decimal digits of precision; Single supports 9.|  \n  \n The following example converts the minimum or maximum value of other primitive numeric types to a Single value.  \n  \n [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#20](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_13.vb)]\n [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#20](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_13.cs)]  \n  \n In addition, the <xref:System.Double> values <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Double.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=fullName> covert to <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>, respectively.  \n  \n Note that the conversion of the value of some numeric types to a Single value can involve a loss of precision. As the example illustrates, a loss of precision is possible when converting <xref:System.Decimal>, <xref:System.Double>, <xref:System.Int32>, <xref:System.Int64>, <xref:System.UInt32>, and <xref:System.UInt64> values to Single values.  \n  \n The conversion of a Single value to a <xref:System.Double> is a widening conversion. The conversion may result in a loss of precision if the <xref:System.Double> type does not have a precise representation for the Single value.  \n  \n The conversion of a Single value to a value of any primitive numeric data type other than a <xref:System.Double> is a narrowing conversion and requires a cast operator (in C#) or a conversion method (in Visual Basic). Values that are outside the range of the target data type, which are defined by the target type's `MinValue` and `MaxValue` properties, behave as shown in the following table.  \n  \n|Target type|Result|  \n|-----------------|------------|  \n|Any integral type|An <xref:System.OverflowException> exception if the conversion occurs in a checked context.<br /><br /> If the conversion occurs in an unchecked context (the default in C#), the conversion operation succeeds but the value overflows.|  \n|<xref:System.Decimal>|An <xref:System.OverflowException> exception,|  \n  \n In addition, <xref:System.Single.NaN?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Single.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Single.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=fullName> throw an <xref:System.OverflowException> for conversions to integers in a checked context, but these values overflow when converted to integers in an unchecked context. For conversions to <xref:System.Decimal>, they always throw an <xref:System.OverflowException>. For conversions to <xref:System.Double>, they convert to <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Double.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=fullName>, respectively.  \n  \n Note that a loss of precision may result from converting a Single value to another numeric type. In the case of converting non-integral <xref:System.Double> values, as the output from the example shows, the fractional component is lost when the Single value is either rounded (as in Visual Basic) or truncated (as in C#). For conversions to <xref:System.Decimal> and Single values, the <xref:System.Double> value may not have a precise representation in the target data type.  \n  \n The following example converts a number of Single values to several other numeric types. The conversions occur in a checked context in Visual Basic (the default) and in C# (because of the [checked](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) keyword). The output from the example shows the result for conversions in both a checked an unchecked context. You can perform conversions in an unchecked context in Visual Basic by compiling with the `/removeintchecks+` compiler switch and in C# by commenting out the `checked` statement.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#21](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_14.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#21](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_14.vb)]  \n  \n For more information on the conversion of numeric types, see [Type Conversion in the .NET Framework](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) and [Type Conversion Tables](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Functionality\"></a>   \n## Floating-point functionality  \n The Single structure and related types provide methods to perform the following categories of operations:  \n  \n-   **Comparison of values**. You can call the <xref:System.Single.Equals%2A> method to determine whether two Single values are equal, or the <xref:System.Single.CompareTo%2A> method to determine the relationship between two values.  \n  \n     The Single structure also supports a complete set of comparison operators. For example, you can test for equality or inequality, or determine whether one value is greater than or equal to another value. If one of the operands is a <xref:System.Double>, the Single value is converted to a <xref:System.Double> before performing the comparison. If one of the operands is an integral type, it is converted to a Single before performing the comparison. Although these are widening conversions, they may involve a loss of precision.  \n  \n    > [!WARNING]\n    >  Because of differences in precision, two Single values that you expect to be equal may turn out to be unequal, which affects the result of the comparison. See the [Testing for equality](#Equality) section for more information about comparing two Single values.  \n  \n     You can also call the <xref:System.Single.IsNaN%2A>, <xref:System.Single.IsInfinity%2A>, <xref:System.Single.IsPositiveInfinity%2A>, and <xref:System.Single.IsNegativeInfinity%2A> methods to test for these special values.  \n  \n-   **Mathematical operations**. Common arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented by language compilers and Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instructions rather than by Single methods. If the other operand in a mathematical operation is a <xref:System.Double>, the Single is converted to a <xref:System.Double> before performing the operation, and the result of the operation is also a <xref:System.Double> value. If the other operand is an integral type, it is converted to a Single before performing the operation, and the result of the operation is also a Single value.  \n  \n     You can perform other mathematical operations by calling `static` (`Shared` in Visual Basic) methods in the <xref:System.Math?displayProperty=fullName> class. These include additional methods commonly used for arithmetic (such as <xref:System.Math.Abs%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Math.Sign%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Math.Sqrt%2A?displayProperty=fullName>), geometry (such as <xref:System.Math.Cos%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Math.Sin%2A?displayProperty=fullName>), and calculus (such as <xref:System.Math.Log%2A?displayProperty=fullName>).  In all cases, the Single value is converted to a <xref:System.Double>.  \n  \n     You can also manipulate the individual bits in a Single value. The <xref:System.BitConverter.GetBytes%28System.Single%29?displayProperty=fullName> method returns its bit pattern in a byte array.  By passing that byte array to the <xref:System.BitConverter.ToInt32%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, you can also preserve the Single value's bit pattern in a 32-bit integer.  \n  \n-   **Rounding**. Rounding is often used as a technique for reducing the impact of differences between values caused by problems of floating-point representation and precision. You can round a Single value by calling the <xref:System.Math.Round%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. However, note  that the Single value is converted to a <xref:System.Double> before the method is called, and the conversion can involve a loss of precision.  \n  \n-   **Formatting**. You can convert a Single value to its string representation by calling the <xref:System.Single.ToString%2A> method or by using the [composite formatting](~/add/includes/ajax-current-ext-md.md) feature. For information about how format strings control the string representation of floating-point values, see the [Standard Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Standard%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md) and [Custom Numeric Format Strings](../Topic/Custom%20Numeric%20Format%20Strings.md) topics.  \n  \n-   **Parsing strings**. You can convert the string representation of a floating-point value to a Single value by calling the <xref:System.Single.Parse%2A> or <xref:System.Single.TryParse%2A> method. If the parse operation fails, the <xref:System.Single.Parse%2A> method throws an exception, whereas the <xref:System.Single.TryParse%2A> method returns `false`.  \n  \n-   **Type conversion**. The Single structure provides an explicit interface implementation for the <xref:System.IConvertible> interface, which supports conversion between any two standard .NET Framework data types. Language compilers also support the implicit conversion of values for all other standard numeric types except for the conversion of <xref:System.Double> to Single values. Conversion of a value of any standard numeric type other than a <xref:System.Double> to a Single is a widening conversion and does not require the use of a casting operator or conversion method.  \n  \n     However, conversion of 32-bit and 64-bit integer values can involve a loss of precision. The following table lists the differences in precision for 32-bit, 64-bit, and <xref:System.Double> types:  \n  \n    |Type|Maximum precision (in decimal digits)|Internal precision (in decimal digits)|  \n    |----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|  \n    |<xref:System.Double>|15|17|  \n    |<xref:System.Int32> and <xref:System.UInt32>|10|10|  \n    |<xref:System.Int64> and <xref:System.UInt64>|19|19|  \n    |Single|7|9|  \n  \n     The problem of precision most frequently affects Single values that are converted to <xref:System.Double> values. In the following example, two values produced by identical division operations are unequal, because one of the values is a single-precision floating point value that is converted to a <xref:System.Double>.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[System.Single.Structure#5](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.single_15.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Single.Structure#5](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.single_15.vb)]"

  remarks: "The value of the Epsilon property reflects the smallest positive <xref:System.Single> value that is significant in numeric operations or comparisons when the value of the <xref:System.Single> instance is zero. For example, the following code shows that zero and Epsilon are considered to be unequal values, whereas zero and half the value of Epsilon are considered to be equal.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Epsilon#5](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/f-system.single.epsilon_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Epsilon#5](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/f-system.single.epsilon_1.vb)]  \n  \n More precisely, the single-precision floating-point format consists of a sign, a 23-bit mantissa or significand, and an 8-bit exponent. As the following example shows, zero has an exponent of -126 and a mantissa of 0. Epsilon has an exponent of -126 and a mantissa of 1. This means that Epsilon is the smallest positive <xref:System.Single> value that is greater than zero and represents the smallest possible value and the smallest possible increment for a <xref:System.Single> whose exponent is -126.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Epsilon#6](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/f-system.single.epsilon_2.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Epsilon#6](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/f-system.single.epsilon_2.vb)]  \n  \n However, the Epsilon property is not a general measure of precision of the <xref:System.Single> type; it applies only to <xref:System.Single> instances that have a value of zero.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The value of the Epsilon property is not equivalent to machine epsilon, which represents the upper bound of the relative error due to rounding in floating-point arithmetic.  \n  \n The value of this constant is 1.4e-45.  \n  \n Two apparently equivalent floating-point numbers might not compare equal because of differences in their least significant digits. For example, the C# expression, `(float)1/3 == (float)0.33333`, does not compare equal because the division operation on the left side has maximum precision while the constant on the right side is precise only to the specified digits. If you create a custom algorithm that determines whether two floating-point numbers can be considered equal, you must use a value that is greater than the Epsilon constant to establish the acceptable absolute margin of difference for the two values to be considered equal. (Typically, that margin of difference is many times greater than Epsilon.)  \n  \n## Platform Notes  \n On ARM systems, the value of the Epsilon constant is too small to be detected, so it equates to zero. You can define an alternative epsilon value that equals 1.175494351E-38 instead."

If the difference is less than or equal to that absolute value, the numbers are equal. If it is greater, the numbers are not equal. One way to do this is to arbitrarily select an absolute value. However, this is problematic, because an acceptable margin of difference depends on the magnitude of the <xref:System.Single> values. A second way takes advantage of a design feature of the floating-point format: The difference between the mantissa components in the integer representations of two floating-point values indicates the number of possible floating-point values that separates the two values. For example, the difference between 0.0 and <xref:System.Single.Epsilon> is 1, because <xref:System.Single.Epsilon> is the smallest representable value when working with a <xref:System.Single> whose value is zero. The following example uses this technique to compare .33333 and 1/3, which are the two <xref:System.Double> values that the previous code example with the Equals method found to be unequal. Note that the example uses the <xref:System.BitConverter.GetBytes%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.BitConverter.ToInt32%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to convert a single-precision floating-point value to its integer representation.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Single.Equals#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.single.equals-s_0_3.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Single.Equals#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.single.equals-s_0_3.vb)]  \n  \n The precision of floating-point numbers beyond the documented precision is specific to the implementation and version of the .NET Framework.

This means that white space and thousands separators are allowed but currency symbols are not.

To parse a string by using the formatting information of a specific culture, use the <xref:System.Single.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29> or <xref:System.Single.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.Globalization.NumberStyles%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29> method.  \n  \n Ordinarily, if you pass the <xref:System.Single.Parse%2A> method a string that is created by calling the <xref:System.Single.ToString%2A> method, the original <xref:System.Single> value is returned. However, because of a loss of precision, the values may not be equal.  \n  \n If a separator is encountered in the `s` parameter during a parse operation, and the applicable currency or number decimal and group separators are the same, the parse operation assumes that the separator is a decimal separator rather than a group separator.

The sign can appear at the beginning of `s` if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag, and it can appear at the end of `s` if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag. Parentheses can be used in `s` to indicate a negative value if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag.  \n  \n *integral-digits*  \n A series of digits ranging from 0 to 9 that specify the integral part of the number. The *integral-digits* element can be absent if the string contains the *fractional-digits* element.  \n  \n ,  \n A culture-specific group separator. The current culture's group separator symbol can appear in `s` if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag  \n  \n .  \n A culture-specific decimal point symbol. The current culture's decimal point symbol can appear in `s` if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag.  \n  \n *fractional-digits*  \n A series of digits ranging from 0 to 9 that specify the fractional part of the number. Fractional digits can appear in `s` if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag.  \n  \n E  \n The \"e\" or \"E\" character, which indicates that the value is represented in exponential (scientific) notation. The `value` parameter can represent a number in exponential notation if `style` includes the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flag.  \n  \n *exponential-digits*  \n A series of digits ranging from 0 to 9 that specify an exponent.  \n  \n A string with digits only (which corresponds to the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> style) always parses successfully. The remaining <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> members control elements that may be present, but are not required to be present, in the input string. The following table indicates how individual <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles> flags affect the elements that may be present in `s`.  \n  \n|NumberStyles value|Elements permitted in `s` in addition to digits|  \n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *integral-digits* element only.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The decimal point (*.*) and *fractional-digits* elements.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The \"e\" or \"E\" character, which indicates exponential notation. This flag by itself supports values in the form *digits*E*digits*; additional flags are needed to successfully parse strings with such elements as positive or negative signs and decimal point symbols.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *ws* element at the beginning of `s`.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *ws* element at the end of `s`.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *sign* element at the beginning of `s`.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *sign* element at the end of `s`.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *sign* element in the form of parentheses enclosing the numeric value.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The thousands separator (,) element.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The currency ($) element.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|All elements. However, `s` cannot represent a hexadecimal number or a number in exponential notation.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The *ws* element at the beginning or end of `s`, *sign* at the beginning of `s`, and the decimal point (.) symbol. The `s` parameter can also use exponential notation.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|The `ws`, `sign`, thousands separator (,) and decimal point (.) elements.|  \n|<xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles>|All elements. However, `s` cannot represent a hexadecimal number.|  \n  \n Some examples of `s` are \"100\", \"-123,456,789\", \"123.45e+6\", \"+500\", \"5e2\", \"3.1416\", \"600.\", \"-.123\", and \"-Infinity\".  \n  \n The `s` parameter is parsed using the formatting information in a <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that is initialized for the current system culture. To specify the culture whose formatting information is used for the parse operation, call the <xref:System.Single.Parse%28System.String%2CSystem.Globalization.NumberStyles%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29> overload.  \n  \n Ordinarily, if you pass the <xref:System.Single.Parse%2A> method a string that is created by calling the <xref:System.Single.ToString%2A> method, the original <xref:System.Single> value is returned. However, because of a loss of precision, the values may not be equal.  \n  \n If a separator is encountered in the `s` parameter during a parse operation, and the applicable currency or number decimal and group separators are the same, the parse operation assumes that the separator is a decimal separator rather than a group separator. For more information about separators, see <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyDecimalSeparator%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NumberDecimalSeparator%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyGroupSeparator%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NumberGroupSeparator%2A>."

  summary: Converts the string representation of a number in a specified culture-specific format to its single-precision floating-point number equivalent.
  remarks: "This overload is typically used to convert text that can be formatted in a variety of ways to a <xref:System.Single> value. For example, it can be used to convert the text entered by a user into an HTML text box to a numeric value.  \n  \n The `s` parameter is interpreted using a combination of the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.NumberStyles?displayProperty=fullName> flags. The `s` parameter can contain <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.PositiveInfinitySymbol%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NegativeInfinitySymbol%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, or <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NaNSymbol%2A?displayProperty=fullName> for the culture specified by `provider`, or it can contain a string of the form:  \n  \n [*ws*][*sign*]*integral-digits*[*.*[*fractional-digits*]][E[*sign*]*exponential-digits*][*ws*]  \n  \n Optional elements are framed in square brackets ([ and ]).

When the Parse method is invoked, it calls the `provider` parameter's <xref:System.IFormatProvider.GetFormat%2A> method and passes it a <xref:System.Type> object that represents the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> type. The <xref:System.IFormatProvider.GetFormat%2A> method then returns the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides information about the format of the `s` parameter. There are three ways to use the `provider` parameter to supply custom formatting information to the parse operation:  \n  \n-   You can pass a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the culture that supplies formatting information. Its <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetFormat%2A> method returns the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides numeric formatting information for that culture.  \n  \n-   You can pass the actual <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides numeric formatting information. (Its implementation of <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.GetFormat%2A> just returns itself.)  \n  \n-   You can pass a custom object that implements <xref:System.IFormatProvider>. Its <xref:System.IFormatProvider.GetFormat%2A> method instantiates and returns the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides formatting information.  \n  \n If `provider` is `null` or a <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> cannot be obtained, the formatting information for the current system culture is used.  \n  \n If a separator is encountered in the `s` parameter during a parse operation, and the applicable currency or number decimal and group separators are the same, the parse operation assumes that the separator is a decimal separator rather than a group separator. For more information about separators, see <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyDecimalSeparator%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NumberDecimalSeparator%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyGroupSeparator%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NumberGroupSeparator%2A>.  \n  \n Some examples of `s` are \"100\", \"-123,456,789\", \"123.45e+6\", \"+500\", \"5e2\", \"3.1416\", \"600.\", \"-.123\", and \"-Infinity\"."

  summary: Converts the string representation of a number to its single-precision floating-point number equivalent. A return value indicates whether the conversion succeeded or failed.
  remarks: "This overload differs from the <xref:System.Single.Parse%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> method by returning a Boolean value that indicates whether the parse operation succeeded instead of returning the parsed numeric value. It eliminates the need to use exception handling to test for a <xref:System.FormatException> in the event that `s` is invalid and cannot be successfully parsed.  \n  \n The `s` parameter can contain <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.PositiveInfinitySymbol%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NegativeInfinitySymbol%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NaNSymbol%2A> (the string comparison is case-sensitive), or a string of the form:  \n  \n [ws][sign][integral-digits,]integral-digits[.[fractional-digits]][e[sign]exponential-digits][ws]  \n  \n Elements in square brackets are optional.

This means that white space and thousands separators are allowed but currency symbols are not. To explicitly define the elements (such as currency symbols, thousands separators, and white space) that can be present in `s`, use the <xref:System.Single.TryParse%28System.String%2CSystem.Globalization.NumberStyles%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Single%40%29> method overload.  \n  \n The `s` parameter is parsed using the formatting information in a <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that is initialized for the current system culture. For more information, see <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrentInfo%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. To parse a string using the formatting information of some other specified culture, use the <xref:System.Single.TryParse%28System.String%2CSystem.Globalization.NumberStyles%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%2CSystem.Single%40%29> method overload.  \n  \n Ordinarily, if you pass the <xref:System.Single.TryParse%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method a string that is created by calling the <xref:System.Single.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, the original <xref:System.Single> value is returned. However, because of a loss of precision, the values may not be equal.  \n  \n If a separator is encountered in the `s` parameter during a parse operation, and the applicable currency or number decimal and group separators are the same, the parse operation assumes that the separator is a decimal separator rather than a group separator.

The <xref:System.IFormatProvider.GetFormat%2A> method then returns the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides information about the format of the `s` parameter. There are three ways to use the `provider` parameter to supply custom formatting information to the parse operation:  \n  \n-   You can pass a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the culture that supplies formatting information. Its <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.GetFormat%2A> method returns the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides numeric formatting information for that culture.  \n  \n-   You can pass the actual <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides numeric formatting information. (Its implementation of <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.GetFormat%2A> just returns itself.)  \n  \n-   You can pass a custom object that implements <xref:System.IFormatProvider>. Its <xref:System.IFormatProvider.GetFormat%2A> method instantiates and returns the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object that provides formatting information.  \n  \n If `provider` is `null`, the formatting of `s` is interpreted based on the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object of the current culture.  \n  \n If a separator is encountered in the `s` parameter during a parse operation, and the applicable currency or number decimal and group separators are the same, the parse operation assumes that the separator is a decimal separator rather than a group separator. For more information about separators, see <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyDecimalSeparator%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NumberDecimalSeparator%2A>, <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.CurrencyGroupSeparator%2A>, and <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo.NumberGroupSeparator%2A>."
