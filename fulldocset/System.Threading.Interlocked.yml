  type: Class
  summary: Provides atomic operations for variables that are shared by multiple threads.
  remarks: "The methods of this class help protect against errors that can occur when the scheduler switches contexts while a thread is updating a variable that can be accessed by other threads, or when two threads are executing concurrently on separate processors. The members of this class do not throw exceptions.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked.Decrement%2A> methods increment or decrement a variable and store the resulting value in a single operation. On most computers, incrementing a variable is not an atomic operation, requiring the following steps:  \n  \n1.  Load a value from an instance variable into a register.  \n  \n2.  Increment or decrement the value.  \n  \n3.  Store the value in the instance variable.  \n  \n If you do not use <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked.Increment%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked.Decrement%2A>, a thread can be preempted after executing the first two steps. Another thread can then execute all three steps. When the first thread resumes execution, it overwrites the value in the instance variable, and the effect of the increment or decrement performed by the second thread is lost.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked.Exchange%2A> method atomically exchanges the values of the specified variables. The <xref:System.Threading.Interlocked.CompareExchange%2A> method combines two operations: comparing two values and storing a third value in one of the variables, based on the outcome of the comparison. The compare and exchange operations are performed as an atomic operation."

To keep track of the number of midpoint values, a variable, `midpointCount`, is set equal to 1,000 and decremented each time the random number generator returns a midpoint value. Because three threads generate the random numbers, the Decrement method is called to ensure that multiple threads don't update `midpointCount` concurrently. Note that a lock is also used to protect the random number generator, and that a <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent> object is used to ensure that the `Main` method doesn't finish execution before the three threads.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Threading.Interlocked.Decrement#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/m-system.threading.inter_2_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Interlocked.Decrement#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/m-system.threading.inter_2_1.vb)]  \n  \n The following example is similar to the previous one, except that it uses the  instead of a thread procedure to generate 50,000 random midpoint integers.
