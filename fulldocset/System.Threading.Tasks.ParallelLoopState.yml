  type: Class
  summary: Enables iterations of parallel loops to interact with other iterations. An instance of this class is provided by the <xref href="System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel"></xref> class to each loop; you can not create instances in your code.
  remarks: "Note that you cannot instantiate an instance of this class. It is automatically generated by the compiler as an argument in a call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The example provides an illustration.  \n  \n Constructs such as `for` and `foreach` (in C#) and `For` and `For Each` (in Visual Basic) execute sequentially from the lowest index to the highest or from the first object in a set to the last. In contrast, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods do not. Because individual iterations of the loop run in parallel, they can begin and end in any order. The ParallelLoopState class allows individual iterations of parallel loops to interact with one another. The ParallelLoopState class allows you to:  \n  \n-   Exit the current iteration and prevent any additional iterations from starting by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method. This does not affect iterations that have already begun execution.  \n  \n-   Prevent any iterations with an index greater than the current index from executing by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. This does not affect iterations that have already begun execution.  \n  \n-   Determine whether an exception has occurred in any loop iteration by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.IsExceptional%2A> property.  \n  \n-   Determine whether any iteration of the loop has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.IsStopped%2A> property. You can use this property to return from iterations of the loop that started before the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method but are still executing.  \n  \n-   Determine whether any iteration of the loop has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A>method or has thrown an exception by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property.  \n  \n-   Exit from a long-running iteration whose index is greater than the index of an iteration in which Break was called by retrieving the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property."
  example:
  - "The following example executes up to 100 iterations of a loop in parallel. Each iteration pauses for a random interval from 1 to 1,000 milliseconds. A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method is called. As the output from the example shows, no iterations whose index is greater than the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property value start after the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method.  \n  \n [!code-cs[System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState#2](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.threading.tasks_1_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState#2](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.tasks_1_1.vb)]  \n  \n Because iterations of the loop are still likely to be executing when the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method is called, each iteration calls the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property to check whether another iteration has called the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. If  the property value is `true`, the iteration checks the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property and, if it is greater than the current iteration's index value, returns immediately."

  summary: Communicates that the <xref href="System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel"></xref> loop should cease execution of iterations beyond the current iteration at the system's earliest convenience.
  remarks: "Break indicates that no iterations after the current iteration should be run. It effectively cancels any additional iterations of the loop. However, it does not stop any iterations that have already begun execution. For example, if Break is called from the 100th iteration of a parallel loop iterating from 0 to 1,000, all iterations less than 100 should still be run, but the iterations from 101 through to 1000 that have not yet started are not executed.  \n  \n For long-running iterations that may already be executing, Break sets the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property to the current iteration's index if the current index is less than the current value of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A>. To stop iterations whose index is greater than the lowest break iteration from competing execution, you should do the following:  \n  \n1.  Check whether the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.ShouldExitCurrentIteration%2A> property is `true`.  \n  \n2.  Exit from the iteration if its index is greater than the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.LowestBreakIteration%2A> property value.  \n  \n The example provides an illustration.  \n  \n Break is typically employed in search-based algorithms where an ordering is present in the data source."

A randomly generated value determines on which iteration of the loop the Break method is called.

  remarks: For long-running iterations of the loop, you can retrieve the value of the IsStopped property to determine whether any iterations of the loop that began execution before the call to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Stop%2A> method are still executing.

  remarks: "It is possible for multiple iterations of a parallel loop to call the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A> method. If they do, this value is the smallest index of an iteration that called <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState.Break%2A>.
