  summary: Represents the method that handles calls from a <xref href="System.Threading.Timer"></xref>.
  remarks: "Use a `TimerCallback` delegate to specify the method that is called by a <xref:System.Threading.Timer>. This method does not execute in the thread that created the timer; it executes in a separate thread pool thread that is provided by the system. The `TimerCallback` delegate invokes the method once after the start time elapses, and continues to invoke it once per timer interval until the <xref:System.Threading.Timer.Dispose%2A> method is called, or until the <xref:System.Threading.Timer.Change%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called with the interval value <xref:System.Threading.Timeout.Infinite>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Callbacks can occur after the <xref:System.Threading.Timer.Dispose> method overload has been called, because the timer queues callbacks for execution by thread pool threads. You can use the <xref:System.Threading.Timer.Dispose%28System.Threading.WaitHandle%29> method overload to wait until all callbacks have completed.  \n  \n The timer delegate is specified when the timer is constructed, and cannot be changed. The start time for a `Timer` is passed in the `dueTime` parameter of the `Timer` constructors, and the period is passed in the `period` parameter. For an example that demonstrates creating and using a `TimerCallback` delegate, see <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName>."
  example:
  - "The following code example shows how to create the delegate used with the `Timer` class.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Threading.Timer#1](~/add/codesnippet/cpp/t-system.threading.timer_1.cpp)]\n [!code-cs[System.Threading.Timer#1](~/add/codesnippet/csharp/t-system.threading.timer_1.cs)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Timer#1](~/add/codesnippet/visualbasic/t-system.threading.timer_1.vb)]"
